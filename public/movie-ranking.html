<h1>The 5 Highest Grossing Marvel Movies of All Time</h1>
  <h2>Which Marvel movie made the most money in North America?</h2>
<hr/>
   <h3>5. The Avengers (2012)<br/>
       $623,357,910</h3>
    <p>The beginning of the ensemble Avengers movies: The Avengers exploded onto the scene as the third-highest-grossing movie of all time. Brought on by the reckless terrorism and invasion of Earth by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the Avengers Initiative officially enacts to defend humanity from almost-certain destruction. Since it was announced in 2008 that this star-studded superhero movie would be released in 2011 with the core Avengers, it is a shock to no one that this movie was an immediate hit.</p>
   <h3>4. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)<br/>
       $678,815,482</h3>
        <p>Juggling an impressively large cast of superheroes for the third Avengers installment, Avengers: Infinity War jumps leagues above its predecessors in multiple respects. Determined by his goal to acquire all infinity stones and wipe out half of all life, Thanos (Josh Brolin) proves himself as The Avengers’ most formidable foe yet. Since this very re-watchable movie capitalizes on near-non-stop action as well as emotional adversity, its lifetime gross has gone up exponentially and will most likely continue to do so.</p>
   <h3>3. Black Panther (2018)<br/>
    $700,059,566</h3>
    <p>A truly unique addition to the Marvel cinematic universe, Black Panther developed a huge following well before its actual release date, promising a fortuitous and long-lasting future to come. King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is next in line as the leader and protector of Wakanda but is suddenly challenged by a shadow from the past, one with a chip on his shoulder and a score to settle. The Kendrick Lamar and Ludwig Göransson Black Panther music is also to be thanked for its achievements in popularity, winning a Best Score Oscar and Grammy as well as a Grammy for “King’s Dead” from Lamar’s curated Black Panther album.</p>
    <h3>2. Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)<br/>
        $804,793,477</h3>
        <p>The newest and most exciting Spider-Man movie is Spider-Man: No Way Home; an insanely fun cast-blending experiment that combines all Spider-Man iterations into one glorious adventure. After Spider-Man’s (Tom Holland) true identity is announced on the news, he seeks the help of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to undo what has been done, sparking a chain of events that bring multiple universes crashing together. With the promise of every actor who’s played Spider-Man and their respective foes to be included, even the most skeptical viewers deemed it necessary to see this movie as soon as possible.</p>
    <h3>1. Avengers: Endgame (2019)<br/>
        $858,373,000</h3>
            <p>Serving as the epic conclusion to the ensemble cast of Avengers movies, Avengers: Endgame is an emotionally charged experience of nostalgia, revenge, and redemption. Set years after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, the remaining Avengers woefully re-unite to attempt to undo the devastating actions taken by Thanos. With a 3-hour runtime, Endgame sets out to settle scores, finish off multiple subplots, and leave audiences with a satisfactory goodbye to their favorite movie saga.</p>
